## Spatial Clustering Metrics
### Before We Get Started...

Let's review some key metrics of spatial clustering that are often used in epidemiological research.

We will go over:

- **Isolation** (and its inverse, **Interaction**)
- **Dissimilarity**
- **Moran's I**

#### Notation

We will use the following notation throughout:

- $A$ = Total number of majority group members.

- $B$ = Total number of minority group members (i.e. $B$ < $A$).

- $a_i$ = Number of majority group members in area $i$.

- $b_i$ = Number of minority group members in area $i$.

- $t_i$ = Total population of area $i$ (i.e. $a_i + b_i$).

- $N$ = Total overall population size (i.e. $A + B$).

## Metric: Isolation & Interaction
### Isolation

If we have two groups $a$ and $b$, in which $b$ is a minority group, i.e. $N_{b} < N_{a}$, isolation measures the **proportion of the contacts among minority group members** that are within-group. 

Isolation can be calculated as:

$$
\sum_{i}^{N}\left[\left(\frac{b_i}{B}\right)\left(\frac{b_i}{t_i}\right)\right]
$$
In `R` we can write this as:
```{r eval=FALSE}
isolation <- function(a,b) {
  t <- a + b
  a <- a[n > 0]
  b <- b[n > 0]
  total_b <- sum(b)
  d <- sum((b/total_a)*(t/n))
  return(d)
}
```

- $b$ is a **vector**: each entry in the vector represents the number of **minority group members** in each area $i$
  - the vector $b$ has a length of $G$, where $1 \le i \le G$
- $a$ is a **number**: it represents the number of **majority group members** in each area $i$


<h3> Interaction </h3>

Interaction quantifies the **inverse of isolation**: what proportion of the minority group's contacts are with the majority group:

$$
\sum_{i}^{N}\left[\left(\frac{b_i}{B}\right)\left(\frac{a_i}{t_i}\right)\right]
$$

## Metric: Dissimilarity
### Dissimilarity

Another common measure of clustering or segregation is the **index of dissimilarity**. This takes on a value between 0 and 1 and indicates the **proportion** of the majority or minority group that moves to match overall population-level distributions.


$$
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^{N} \left| \frac{a_i}{A} - \frac{b_i}{B} \right|
$$

Each "term" (i.e. $\frac{a_i}{A}$) inside the vertical bars (which indicate absolute value) represents the **proportion of the total population of each group living in area $i$**. 

If both $\frac{a_i}{A}$ and $\frac{b_i}{B}$ equal 0, that means that the proportion of majority and minority group members in each area $i$ **is the same as** the overall proportion of majority and minority group members in the general population. 

Similarly, for this value to sum to 1, each area $i$ will only have members of one group (either all majority or all minority) present.


This is also easy to write out in `R`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dissimilarity <- function(a,b) {
  total_a <- sum(x)
  total_b <- sum(n-x)
  d <- 0.5*sum(abs((a/total_a) - ((b)/total_b)))
  return(d)
}
```

## Metric: Moran's I
### Moran's I
The prior two measures (Isolation/Interaction and Dissimilarity) are **aspatial** — that means that **areal factors** such as census tract, neighborhood, and zipcode **don't impact them**. 

You can tell this is the case because the equations for each includes nothing about the **distance** between locations or the **adjacency** of locations (for instance, there isn't information on whether or not locations are touching each other at any point). 

To calculate Moran's I, we'll introduce a couple of new items of notation:

- $w_{ij}$ is the **weight of connection** between areas $i$ and $j$. We will assume that $w_{ij} = 1$ when two areas are touching, and that $w_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. 
  - $w$ can be more complicated — it can be a **function of distance** as well.

- $W$ is the sum of all the weights.

We can then define Moran's I like this:

$$
\frac{N}{W} \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_{ij}(\frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{B}{N})(\frac{b_j}{B} - \frac{B}{N})}{\sum_{i}(\frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{B}{N})^2}
$$

You can see here that instead of evaluating individual cells one at a time, **we look at them in pairs**. 

Each $\frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{B}{N}$ term is measuring the **deviation** from the population-average proportion of the minority group for each location. The closer $(\frac{b_i}{B}- \frac{B}{N})$ and$(\frac{b_j}{B}- \frac{B}{N})$ are to each other among pairs with larger weights, the greater the value of **I**. 

Unlike with the first two measures, **I** can take on negative and positive values.

- **1** (*a dissimilarity value of 1*) indicates perfect correlation. All individuals are clustered among like-individuals.
- **-1** indicates perfect repulsion, like a checkerboard:

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="*Majority group individuals and Minority group individuals forming perfectly repelled clusters.*"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/checkerboard.png")
```

- **0** indicates a fully random distribution, analogous to a 0 in the index of dissimilarity.

## Measuring Clusters
### Clustering in the City: A Hypothetical Scenario
In this example, we'll look at different ways of measuring the concentration of unvaccinated children in different neighborhoods of a hypothetical city. 

The clustering of unvaccinated individuals may indicate an **elevated risk of outbreaks** of preventable childhood infections, such as measles. 

An ideal measure of the risk associated with this clustering would map well onto our **qualitative** understanding of the process of infectious disease transmission.


<center><h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: oblique">How does clustering impact outbreak levels?<h4></center>


To explore this question, we'll start with a simple scenario:

We have city in which each individual lives in 1 of 64 blocks that are divided into **groups of 32**, half on the **high-risk west (left) side** and half on the **lower-risk east (right) side**.

In addition to the east and west side, let's break the city down further into:

1. 4 **quadrants**, which each contain
2. 4 **neighborhoods** (16 neighborhoods per quadrant, 32 total neighborhoods), which contain
3. 4 **blocks** each (16 blocks per neighborhood, 64 total blocks)

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap="*Quadrants, Neighborhoods, and Blocks*"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quad-neigh-block.png")
```

Within each of the quadrant and neighborhood, there is one **high risk area**, corresponding to the bottom-left neighborhood or block, respectively. You can control the odds of unvaccinated-ness for children living in the high-risk areas as compared to their enclosing neighborhoods and blocks using the sliders below the figure.

```{r makegrid, echo=FALSE}
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel(
    h4("Model Parameters"),
    sliderInput(
      "punvax",
      "Proportion Unvaccinated in Lowest Risk Area",
      min = 0.01,
      max = 0.5,
      value = 0.1
    ),
    sliderInput(
      "hor",
      "High-Risk (left side) Odds Ratio",
      min = 1.01,
      max = 10.0,
      value = 1.1
    ),
    
    
  radioButtons("ntype", "Neighbor Type:",
               c("Rook" = "rook",
                 "Queen" = "queen")),
  ),
  
  # mainPanel(tabsetPanel(
